## UI5Lab-browser

A browser to display custom libraries and control examples on the UI5Lab homepage. The app implemented in UI5 can also be used for testing control samples and previewing libraries during development.

Source: [https://github.com/UI5Lab/UI5Lab-browser](https://github.com/UI5Lab/UI5Lab-browser)

Demo: [Browser](https://ui5lab.io/browser)

Used in: [UI5Lab-central](https://github.com/UI5Lab/UI5Lab-central) [UI5Lab-library-simple](https://github.com/UI5Lab/UI5Lab-central)

The browser is an app for displaying library information and control samples based on metadata that is located inside the library projects.
The application logic is similar for both use cases:
* Displaying a library during library development at design time
 * Developing Samples and Tests
 * High-Level library and control documentation
 * Testing the appearance of the library and its content on the UI5Lab homepage
* Listing a library on the UI5Lab homepage so that it can be easily found by app developers at run time
  * Search and find community controls or artifacts at the UI5Lab homepage
  * Browse samples, high-level documentation, and test pages for all artifacts
  * Link the project repository to contribute or report issues

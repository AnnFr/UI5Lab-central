*High-level overview and current status of the UI5Lab ecosystem*

UI5Lab Browser
The browser is a draft for displaying libraries and its content based on metadata that is located inside the library projects (see TODO section for improvment ideas). As such, the logic is similar for both use cases:

Displaying a library during library development at design time
Developing Samples and Tests
High-Level library and control documentation
Testing the appearance of the library and its content on the UI5Lab homepage
Listing a library on the UI5Lab homepage so that it can be easily found by app developers at run time
Search and find community controls or artifacts at the UI5Lab homepage
Browse samples, high-level documentation, and test pages for all artifacts
Link the project repository to contribute or report issues

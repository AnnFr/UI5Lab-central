# UI5Lab - What is it?
A place to gather forces and work on a UI5 community-driven custom UI5 repository.
Whatever will be placed here is discussed in [Slack Channel #UI5Lab](https://openui5.slack.com/messages/UI5lab).
You can join with this [invitation link for Slack](http://slackui5invite.herokuapp.com/).

# What to contribute?
First and foremost, code content is what drives the vision behind this UI5Lab project: a wealth of code content from many contributers in one central place and have a vibrant exchange. So any self-developed unit of work, be it custom control, template, or an app, is welcome for sharing with others. 
In addition, the final vision would have some levers that allow effective access to the code content: 
* A build job that'll assemble the content to a compendium similar to the OpenUI5 Explored Samples is part of the vision. 
* A tool for consumption would be desirable, something that would facilitate downloading of individual pieces of work.

# How to contribute?
There are two boards on Trello to coordinate our common work: the [prototype board](https://trello.com/b/gFQs9ARW/prototype) and the [orga board](https://trello.com/b/v8thvLem/orga). Everyone can create tasks in one of the boards and update them as progress takes place. To get write access, post a request on slack to one of the admins, then join the board (button on the left panel in one of the boards).  

For contributing technically on GitHub, this is how to proceed: 
1. Get registered on GitHub.com so that you have your own Profile. 
2. Go to the openui5/UI5Lab repository and click on the "fork" button in the upper right corner. A pop-up will appear asking you where to fork it to -> choose your profile. 
3. Edit one or many pages on the forked repository. 
4. After you've finished, you can create a "pull" request to get it merged with the openui5/UI5Lab repository. At the point of your pull-request creation, someone from the UI5Lab administrators will check your changes and merge them - or possibly get back to you with questions.

For contributing code content on GitHub, this is how to proceed:
1. Get registered on GitHub.com so that you have your own Profile.
2. Develop or uploard your unit of work including the documentation to a repository under your profile
3. Link it to this repository to make it available to other people
4. Post a note on slack to let others know of your achievement.

# Some more Words on the Infrastructure
What if problems occur? Issues can be created in this repository. To do this, just go to the "Issues" tab on the top left side of this panel and post your problem.

What if you'd like to share knowledge? The Wiki page is the right area for that. Just go to the "Wiki" tab in the top center of this panel to create a Wiki entry. 

Guides should also be available for the build job, metadata and the app providing the consumtion functionality.

# Documentation
Documentation should always be published together with your work. It is important that other people understand what your motivation was for your work, what it does, and how you implemented it. Understanding what your work does is also the prerequisite for the information exchange amongst the members of the community. Even if you just want to fool around (which is perhaps the best motivation to begin with) - let the rest of us know what drove you.

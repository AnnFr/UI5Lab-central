# UI5Lab - What is it?
A place to gather forces and work on a UI5 community-driven custom UI5 repository.
Whatever will be placed here is discussed in [Slack Channel #UI5Lab](https://openui5.slack.com/messages/UI5lab).
You can join with this [invitation link for Slack](http://slackui5invite.herokuapp.com/).

# What to contribute?
First and foremost, code content is what drives the vision to have a vibrant exchange. So any self-developed unit of work, be it custom control, template, or an app, is welcome for sharing with others. 
In addition, the final vision would have some levers that allow effective access to the code content. Consequently, a build job that'll assemble the content to a compendium similar to the OpenUI5 Explored Samples is part of the vision. In addition, a tool for consumption would be desirable, something that would facilitate downloading of individual pieces of work.

# How to contribute?
There are two boards on Trello we use for coordinating our common work: the prototype board and the orga board. As this vision may be shared by all members of the community, you can create tasks in one of the boards and update them as you progress. And wouldn't it be great if someone else in the community would pick up a task you have posted? We all hope that it'll be fun to work together and build on each others work and ideas.  
For contributing technically on GitHub, this is what you should do: get registered on GitHub.com so that you have your own Profile. 
Then, you go to the openui5/UI5Lab repository and click on the "fork" button in the upper right corner. A pop-up will appear asking you where to fork it to -> choose your profile. Now you can edit all pages on the repository. After you've finished, you can create a "pull" request to get it merged with th eopenui5/UI5Lab repository. At the point of your pull-request creation, someone from the UI5Lab administrators will check your changes and merge them - or possibly get back to you with questions.

# Some more Words on the Infrastructure
What if problems occur? Issues can be created in this repository. To do this, just go to the "Issues" tab on the top left side of this panel and post your problem.
What if you'd like to share knowledge? The Wiki page is the right area for that. Just go to the "Wiki" tab in the top center of this panel to create a Wiki entry. 

# Documentation
Please always make sure that you publish the accompanying documentation together with your unit of work. It is important that other people understand what your motivation was for your work, what it does, where you see it's benefit, and what it means to you. Only then is it possible to come close to each other and have something to say to each other. Even if you just want to fool around (which is perhaps the best motivation to begin with) - let the rest of us know what drove you. It'll be incredibly interesting to see what mongrel or beauty may evolve from a crazy idea - you may know, many a paradigm-changing invention was a laboratory accident or a by-product. But let's end on a happy note: this is suppoed to be fun, so let's not limit our imagination.

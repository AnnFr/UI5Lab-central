# UI5Lab - What is it?
A place to gather forces and work on a UI5 community-driven custom repository accompanied by vibrant exchange. 
Whatever will be placed here is discussed in [Slack Channel #UI5Lab](https://openui5.slack.com/messages/UI5lab).
You can join with this [invitation link for Slack](http://slackui5invite.herokuapp.com/).

# What to contribute?
Your contributions will drive the vision behind the UI5Lab project: A place where custom controls, templates, helper classes, and code artifacts related to UI5 technology can be discovered and shared by the community. How can this be achieved?

* The custom code should be developed and maintained in individual repositories for maximum flexibility, you are welcome to suggest your code project as a pilot for UI5lab
  * An example control (work in progress) with a very simple codebase can be found here:
[UI5Lab-control-simple](https://github.com/openui5/UI5Lab-control-simple)
  * Feel free to also contribute to the example project to make it more robust

* In this repository we would like to provide infrastructure for discovering and assembling a compendium of all individual code repositories. The idea is to easily find documentation and samples for all the above projects and to have them listed in a central place
  * A build infrastructure could retrieve the content based on metadata on a regular basis and list it here to  assemble a custom samples browser
  * Guides are needed to describe the overall setup and the infrastructure, the [Wiki page](https://github.com/openui5/UI5Lab/wiki) of this repository could be used to store these

* An app that wants to consume one of the above mentioned projects needs an infrastructure and tools to integrate the individual pieces of work into their existing codebase and update them.
  * An example app (work in progress) with basic consumption can be found here:
[UI5Lab-app-simple](https://github.com/openui5/UI5Lab-app-simple)
  * An example library (work in progress) of custom controls can be found here:
[UI5Lab-library-simple](https://github.com/openui5/UI5Lab-library-simple)
  * The tools to create and consume a custom library and controls are not existing yet for this project. This is where our next steps will happen together.

# How to contribute?
There are two boards on Trello to coordinate our common work: the [prototype board](https://trello.com/b/gFQs9ARW/prototype) and the [orga board](https://trello.com/b/v8thvLem/orga). Everyone can create tasks in one of the boards and update them as progress takes place. To get write access, post a request on slack to one of the admins, then join the board (button on the left panel in one of the boards).  

For contributing technically on GitHub, this is how to proceed: 
1. Share your idea on slackchat. 
2. Fork one of the openui5/UI5Lab repositories.  
3. Create a new "pull" request to get it merged. 

# Some more Words on the Infrastructure
What if problems occur? Issues can be created in this repository. To do this, just go to the "Issues" tab on the top left side of this panel and post your problem.

What if you'd like to share knowledge? The Wiki page is the right area for that. Just go to the "Wiki" tab in the top center of this panel to create a Wiki entry. Later on, guides can be made available on the [Wiki page](https://github.com/openui5/UI5Lab/wiki).

# First Contributions
There are already four contributions from the community:
* [A SAPUI5 custom control that wraps flatpickr Date Picker](https://github.com/StErMi/openui5-flatpickr)
* [A SAPUI5 custom control that allow you to generate and easily embed QR code inside your SAPUI5 application](https://github.com/StErMi/openui5-qrcode)
* [Simple HTML5 charts using the canvas element chartjs.org](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js)
* [An introductory project on plotly, a high-level, declarative charting library](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js)

A heart-felt "thank you" to our contributors!
